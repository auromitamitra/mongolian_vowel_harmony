Svantesson 2005:

Long and short [o] --> are written with the same Cyrillic letter (ɵɵ and ɵ). But differ in vowel quality. In a narrow phonetic transcription they could be written as [o:] and [ɵ].

From Khalka_VH_summary.pdf:

the front- rounded vowels of Classical Mongolian [y] and [ɵ] have developed into back rounded vowels [u] and [o] in Khalkha.

## Length diacritic in transcription:
In Svantensson 2005: 
Analysis: long vowels occur only in initial syllables. So in inintial position: can have long or short vowels. In non-initial position: can have full or reduced vowels.

so in transcriptions: length diacritic used only for initial-syllable vowels. Initial short vowels and non-initial full vowels--no diacritic, non-initial reduced vowels--reduced diacritic.

In Cyrillic writing system, both initial long vowels and non-initial full vowels are written with double symbol.

In spreadsheet transcriptions: follow the Cyrillic convention: initial long vowels and non-initial full vowels--length diacritic, short and reduced vowels--no diacritic.

- fifty-nine target words and six distractors in carrier phrases
- total number of critical items was 59 x 4 x 4=944
- extract formants from 10 points in each V1-C-V2 sequence


- Distal formants = mid-point of V1, midpoint of V2
- Proximal formants = offset of V1, onset of V2

Distal formants:
1. Plot all the V1 vowels (midpoints)
2. Plot all the V2 vowels (midpoints)

Proximal formants:
1. Plot all V1 vowels (offset)
2. Plot all V2 vowels (onset)

&nbsp;

Measure vowel polygons for all 4

Compare 1 vs 2 for each (distal and proximal pairs)

---
### Analysis:
&nbsp;

effect of (F1 of V1 + V1 identity) on F1 of V2

effect of (F1 of V2 + V2 identity) on F1 of V1

(both distal formants)

Same for F2

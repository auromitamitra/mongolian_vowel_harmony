The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},

	Abstract = {Coarticulation is a source of acoustic variability for vowels, but how large is this effect relative to other sources of variance? We investigate acoustic effects of anticipatory V-to-V coarticulation relative to variation due to the following C and individual speaker. We examine \{F1\} and \{F2\} from \{V1\} in 48 V1-C♯V2 contexts produced by 10 speakers of American English. \{ANOVA\} reveals significant effects of both \{V2\} and C on \{F1\} and \{F2\} measures of V1. The influence of \{V2\} and C on acoustic variability relative to that of speaker and target vowel identity is evaluated using hierarchical linear regression. Speaker and target vowel account for roughly 80% of the total variance in \{F1\} and F2, but when this variance is partialed out C and \{V2\} account for another 18% (F1) and 63% (F2) of the remaining target vowel variability. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) models are constructed to test the power of target vowel \{F1\} and \{F2\} for predicting C and \{V2\} of the upcoming context. Prediction accuracy is 58% for C-Place, 76% for C-Voicing and 54% for V2, but only when variance due to other sources is factored out. \{MLR\} is discussed as a model of the parsing mechanism in speech perception. },

@article{cole2009,
	Abstract = {In exemplar models of phonology, phonotactic constraints are modeled as emergent from patterns of high activation between units that co-occur with statistical regularity, or as patterns of low activation or inhibition between units that co-occur less frequently or not at all. Exemplar models posit no a priori formal or representational properties to the phonological units or sound patterns that emerge from the statistical regularities of speech, in contrast to analyses in the generative phonology tradition, including Optimality Theory, where sound patterns are determined by well-formedness constraints on phonological structures. This paper focuses on the analysis of long-distance assimilation, i.e., harmony systems, evaluating the predictions of generative analyses based on constraints on representation against typological and experimental evidence. Representational approaches model assimilation with constraints that favor extended feature structures. The question addressed here is whether and how the feature structures of harmony systems can be modeled as emergent structure. It is shown that an exemplar account can model the co-occurrence patterns of harmony systems in the transitional probabilities between segments that share the harmony feature, without invoking feature structure, but that the domain properties of harmony feature structures emerge due to the associations between phonological units (the harmonizing segments) and the morphological units that delimit harmony domains. This association grounds the sound pattern in the lexicon, and provides a ``convergence of regularities'' [Frisch, S., 2007. Levels of representation in acquisition (Commentary). In: Cole, J., Hualde, J.I. (Eds.), Laboratory Phonology, vol. 9. Mounton de Gruyter, Berlin, pp. 339--352] which facilitates learning. },

@article{nguyen2008,
	Abstract = {This paper examines acoustic aspects of vowel harmony (VH), understood as regressive vowel-to-vowel assimilation, in two regional varieties of French in six speakers' productions of 107 disyllabic word pairs. In each word pair, the word-initial vowel (V1) was phonemically either /e/ or /o/, and the word-final stressed vowel (V2) alternated between / e -- ɛ / , / {\o} -- {\oe} / , / o -- / or / i -- a / . Results are consistent with the idea that \{VH\} in French entails variations in tongue height along with related displacement of the tongue position along the front--back axis. These effects were independent of both the number of morphemes and lexical frequency. They were more systematic in Northern than in Southern French speakers' speech. Linear mixed-effects models strongly suggest that \{VH\} is a gradient effect of the trigger on the harmonizing vowel. Results lend support to usage-based phonological approaches regarding gradient phonetic differences as part of the gestural scores that make up the lexicon and that can be variably grammaticalized in different varieties of the language. },

@article{benus2007,
	Abstract = {Using a combination of magnetometry and ultrasound, we examined the articulatory characteristics of the so-called `transparent' vowels [iː], [i], and [eː] in Hungarian vowel harmony. Phonologically, transparent vowels are front, but they can be followed by either front or back suffixes. However, a finer look reveals an underlying phonetic coherence in two respects. First, transparent vowels in back harmony contexts show a less advanced (more retracted) tongue body posture than phonemically identical vowels in front harmony contexts: e.g. [i] in buli-val is less advanced than [i] in bili-vel. Second, transparent vowels in monosyllabic stems selecting back suffixes are also less advanced than phonemically identical vowels in stems selecting front suffixes: e.g. [iː] in {\'\i}r, taking back suffixes, compared to [iː] of h{\'\i}r, taking front suffixes, is less advanced when these stems are produced in bare form (no suffixes). We thus argue that the phonetic degree of tongue body horizontal position correlates with the phonological alternation in suffixes. A hypothesis that emerges from this work is that a plausible phonetic basis for transparency can be found in quantal characteristics of the relation between articulation and acoustics of transparent vowels. More broadly, the proposal is that the phonology of transparent vowels is better understood when their phonological patterning is studied together with their articulatory and acoustic characteristics. },

@article{modarresi2004,
	Abstract = {This study investigated the extent of vowel-to-vowel anticipatory and carry-over coarticulation in \{VCV\} utterances. Five speakers of American English produced open (V.CV) and closed (VC.V) syllable shapes with /i/, /ɔ/, /e/ and /u/ as ``fixed vowel'' contexts and /i/ and /ɔ/ as a ``changing vowel'' context. Medial consonants were /bdgptk/. Anticipatory coarticulation was indexed by measuring the difference in \{F2\} offset frequencies for V1, with a given fixed vowel context, when V2=/i/ vs. /ɔ/ (e.g., [ibi] vs. [ibɔ]); carry-over coarticulation was indexed by measuring the difference in \{F2\} onset frequencies for V2, with a given fixed vowel context, when V1=/i/ vs. /ɔ/ (e.g., [ibi] vs. [ɔbi]). In open syllables, anticipatory exceeded carry-over coarticulation for labial and velar stops, but carry-over effects predominated in alveolar contexts. Alveolars maximally resist anticipatory effects of \{V2\} and thus may allow greater \{V1\} carry-over effects. In closed syllables, carry-over exceeded anticipatory effects across all stops. This was attributed to a short V-to-V temporal interval indexing carry-over effects relative to a disproportionately longer interval separating vowels for anticipatory effects. },

	% 	Abstract = {Three experiments tested the hypothesis that V-to-V coarticulatory organization differs in Shona and English, and that Shona- and English-speaking listeners' sensitivity to V-to-V coarticulatory effects is correspondingly language-specific. An acoustic study of Shona and English CV′CVCV trisyllables (Experiment 1) showed that the two languages differ in the carryover vs. anticipatory influences of stressed and unstressed vowels on each other. In 4IAX discrimination tests in which both Shona and English coarticulatory effects were spliced into different coarticulatory contexts (Experiment 2), Shona and English listeners perceptually compensated more (i.e., attributed more of a vowel's acoustic properties to its coarticulatory context in targeted test trials) for effects that were consistent with their linguistic experience. Similarly, when these listeners identified synthetic target vowels embedded into different vowel contexts (Experiment 3), Shona listeners compensated more (i.e., showed larger category boundary shifts) for the vowel contexts that triggered larger acoustic influences in the production study. English listeners' boundary shifts were more complicated but, when these data were combined with those from a follow-up identification study, they showed the perceptual shifts expected on the basis of the English coarticulatory findings. Overall, the relation between the production and perception data suggests that listeners are attuned to native-language coarticulatory patterns. },

@article{recasens1995,
	Abstract = {This paper compares formant values and patterns of linguopalatalcontact for [I] in the sequences [iIi] and [ala] in both Catalan and German, in order to determine whether differences in consonantal velarization between the two languages influence the degree of vowel-to-consonant coarticulation. Significant \{F2\} and F2- F, differences for [I] in the sequence [ili]indicate that the consonant is velarized in Catalan and non-velarized in German; \{F2\} data for male speakers show a 1500Hz threshold between the two consonantal varieties. This language-dependent significant difference was not found to hold for the dorsopalatal contact as measured by electropalatography; there is, however, a clear trend for dorsal contact at the palatal zone for German [I] to exceed that for Catalan [I]. Moreover, \{F2\} values suggest that the consonant may be less non-velarized in German than in other languages (Italian, Spanish, French). The degree of coarticulation was not inversely related to the degree of velarization in the case analyzed in this paper, i.e., coarticulatory effects from [i] vs. [a] on [I] were not significantly different in German vs. Catalan. Velarized [I] in Catalan is highly resistant to coarticulatory effects from [i] since the two phonetic segments are produced with antagonistic tongue dorsum gestures, i.e., tongue dorsum lowering and retraction, and tongue dorsum raising and fronting. While being non-velarized, German [I] appears to be highly resistant to coarticulatory effects from [i] vs. [a]: F, values for [I] in both vowel environments are less extreme in German than in other languages showing a non-velarized variety of the consonant. These findings suggest that the tongue dorsum for German [I] attains some target position, and are in support of the notion that the velarization/non-velarization distinction proceeds in a scalar, noncategorical fashion. },

PR system and ASR system are quite similar in functionality. The difference between these two is that for PR system the speech signal is converted to phonefootnote{smallest discrete segment of sound in uttered speech} text whereas for ASR system the speech signal is converted to word text. Speech corpus for PR system usually consists of a text corpus, recording data corresponding to the text corpus, phonetic representation of the text corpus and a pronunciation dictionary. Selecting optimum text from available text with balanced phone distribution is an important task for developing high quality PR system. In this paper, we describe our text selection technique and discuss the performance of phone recognition system.},
